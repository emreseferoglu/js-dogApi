JavaScript Project: Dog Information Viewer
This project is a Dog Information Viewer built using plain JavaScript and The Dog API. It fetches and displays a list of dog breeds with their images and basic information. Users can click on a breed to view detailed information, such as temperament, origin, and lifespan, on a separate detail page.

The project demonstrates effective API integration and DOM manipulation without using any frameworks, showcasing clean JavaScript code and a focus on interactive user experiences.
